# Darth Algo implementation ledger

Updated: 2026-09-22 UTC. Owner-facing time zone: America/New_York.

This ledger records verified evidence, not intended state. `live` requires a provider or deployment receipt; `tested` means an offline or local test passed; `blocked` names the exact dependency.

| Workstream | Owner | Status | Dependency | Evidence | Acceptance test | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source repository | Operations | live | GitHub | `dylon-tech/darth-algo-website`, main at `bbd303b` during audit | Connected repository is readable and writable | Keep main as source of truth |
| Production build | Operations | live | Node/Next.js | Vercel production deployment `dpl_GWsUjAY7S5BKmQYySJKiN7GoDTSG` reached READY for commit `b551b71`; public home and `/owner` return 200 | Clean compile, production READY, routes respond | Continue runtime error monitoring |
| Durable OS schema | Operations | tested | Production `DATABASE_URL` | PGlite-backed schema, queue, approval, handoff, Telegram, content, and indicator tests | Full safe-fixture suite passes | Observe production migration and heartbeat |
| Owner command center | Operations | tested | Owner runtime configuration | `/owner`, PWA manifest, session and private-route tests | Phone-sized authenticated command creates durable job | Verify on production iPhone Safari |
| Recurring executor | Operations | live with attention | Vercel cron plus production flags | Independent production `/api/cron/owner-work` runs every minute and `/api/cron/owner-health` runs every five minutes; current public health is `attention` | Fresh cloud heartbeat and successful cron HTTP result | Resolve the exact health issues shown in authenticated owner view |
| Premium carousel workflow | Content | active, awaiting window | Buffer credentials and healthy destinations | Production log records exact three-network campaign assets ready and X/Instagram/Threads `ready_for_daily_window` | Provider receipt and public URL match approved hashes | Verify next provider receipt after the authorized window |
| Indicator prototype workflow | Research | partial | Hosted TradingView session | Production log records one candidate; private testing is blocked, release executor is not connected, and social discovery is waiting for credits | TradingView compile/replay evidence attached to exact source hash | Run supervised private validation; do not release yet |
| Customer support/retention | Support | tested | Support inbox adapter for outbound work | Deterministic routing and retention tables/tests | Verified inbound event creates deduplicated case; resolution cancels follow-up | Connect/verify inbox executor |
| Native reusable skill | Operations | installed | Skills directory | Version `1.0.0` validates and is saved to the reusable skill directory | Validator passes and installed package retains workflow references | Refresh Skills view if it is not immediately visible |
| Supabase | Operations | intentionally retired; not authoritative | All discovered projects inactive | Production runtime is executing successfully against its configured Postgres/Neon database; no Supabase project is referenced | None; excluded from production health | Do not resume or migrate without explicit source-of-truth evidence |

## Stop conditions

- Do not publish, message customers, change offers, spend money, or release an indicator without the existing exact-scope authorization and provider readiness gates.
- Do not retry an uncertain external outcome until readback or reconciliation establishes that the first attempt did not succeed.
- Do not represent queued, configured, compiled, or statically screened work as live execution.
